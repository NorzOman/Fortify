# **Fortify: Mobile Security Suite (v2.0)**

## **Setting up the Backend**

To get the backend up and running, follow these essential steps:

1.  Navigate to the `FORTIFY-SERVER/` directory.

2.  Install all the required Python packages by running the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  The backend extensively utilizes **`jadx`** for its decompilation capabilities. You will need to install **`jadx`** on your system. You can find the official `jadx` releases on GitHub under the releases section. Download the appropriate version and then unzip it.

4.  Ensure you have a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** installed on your system, as **`jadx`** requires it to function correctly.

5.  After unzipping **`jadx`**, copy the absolute path to its executable directory. This path needs to be pasted into the `CORE.py` file. Locate the relevant line (e.g., a variable named `JADX_PATH`) in `CORE.py` that specifies the `jadx` path and update it with your copied path.

6.  Once the **`jadx`** path is correctly configured, you can launch the backend script by running:
    ```bash
    python CORE.py
    ```

7.  Upon successful execution, the script will output two distinct URLs in your terminal:
    *   The "**backend URL**" is your primary API endpoint for integration.
    *   The "**frontend URL**" is provided for convenient testing and direct interaction with Fortify's functionalities.

8.  For enhanced data inspection and understanding, the testing **frontend also contains a direct link to a database viewer**. This can be incredibly useful for examining the data generated by Fortify during scans.

### **Testing Functionality**

*   **Message Scan:** Try initiating a **message scan** request. You should observe the output directly in your terminal. For real-time status updates, you can also send a GET request to the appropriate endpoint.

*   **Malware Scan:** When you begin a **malware scan**, it might initially appear to be stuck. Please be aware that **malware scans take a significant amount of time** as they are diligently processing in the background. For quicker results during testing, we highly recommend using a relatively small application. Alternatively, you can utilize our provided sample APK for testing: [link-to-sample-apk]
