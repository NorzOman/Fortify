# Fortify : Mobile Security Suite (v2.0)

## Overview

This repository contains the full project plan for **Project Fortify**, a complete overhaul of our mobile security initiative. We are building a new, sophisticated mobile application and backend service designed for high-performance phishing and malware detection. This project is a key component of our upcoming research paper.

## Critical Project Updates & Direction

Effective immediately, the project's direction has been significantly changed. Please read the following points carefully:

*   **1. New Android Application Concept:** The mobile app's scope and functionality have been redefined. The focus is now on a lightweight, asynchronous client that interacts powerfully with our new backend. All previous designs are deprecated.

*   **2. Complete Backend Overhaul:** The old backend has been entirely scrapped. We are building a new, faster, and technologically advanced backend from the ground up. This is a non-negotiable requirement for the research paper and demands a robust and modern architecture.

*   **3. Website Client Removed:** The web-based client has been completely removed from the project scope. All time and potential must be focused on the core mobile application and backend services.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING: Quality & Integrity

This is not a typical project. There is **zero tolerance for cutting corners**.

Do not simplify or skip tasks to meet the deadline. At the end of the development cycle, this entire project will be analyzed by external experts as conveyed to me by the faculty. If a single piece of fake, incomplete, or poorly implemented code is found, the integrity of our research paper, our work ,  and our collective reputation will be ruined.

**Execute your assigned tasks completely and correctly. If you cannot, report it. Do not hide it.**
